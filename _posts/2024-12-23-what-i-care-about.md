title: Useful information

I've recently started a new job. I'm joining Amazon as a Principal Content Strategist.

There are, of course, many reasons to take a new job. Most of the time, these reasons revolve around factors such as compensation, work conditions, or location. Sometimes, those reasons are irrelevant: we take a job because we need the work and the financial security it brings. But, every now and then, we might get a chance to think about why we might want one particular job over another. In fact, I would argue that, underneath the tangible benefits that a job provides, there is always a deeper current of motivation, sweeping us along until we find a role that not only satisfies our bank account, but maybe our souls as well.

And so, as I transition into this new role, I wanted to take a moment to ask myself: What do I care about? What is it that really motivates me? 

It's easy to overcomplicate quesitons like these. Your mind can get spun around with all sorts of altruistic goals and lofty ambitions. But aspirations like "I want to change the world" are too easy, precisely because they are so altruistic, so lofty, so vague. So instead I try to find answers that I think are grounded a little more in reality. Sure, I'd like to change the world, but what specifically do I want to change, and why?

My answer, therefore, at this time and in this place, seems to be this:

I care, deeply, about useful information. That may not sound like a very important thing, but to me it is. Useful information is what empowers us to create bold and beautiful things. It allows us to move freely from one idea to the next, stitching them together like notes of a score, a tune of our own making--a tune that, if we're lucky, pleases the ears of others. Useful information is what allows the beginner to become the expert, and to allow the expert to become the teacher.

But useful information does not come freely. It requires discipline, forethought, and analysis. It requires a relentless pursuit of quality that borderlines on the ruthless. It requires a willingness to own not just the information itself, but the entire information experience--from the perspective of those consuming the information to the maintenance of that information over time. Like a chef in a kitchen is not enough to put the food on the plate. You must consider **everything**, from how the customer is seated at a table, to how the server takes their order; from how the dish is presented to how the final bill is rendered. When it comes to information, we have to consider who needs that information, what perspective they bring, what they want to accomplish with that information, and how we can help them evolve and grow.

These ideas are what matter to me. And, as someone who has spent 25 years writing documentation, I find myself thinking that we technical writers, we documnetarians, have so much more to do when it comes to making information useful. Yes, some of us have written very good words in a very good order. And others have done much to prune away the unnecessary so that the essential may shine. But so much useful information remains out of reach for many. And that simple fact prevents customers from succeeding and users from thriving.

I do not have the answers for how to make information useful. But I have ideas, and I want to put those ideas into action. And that, in the end, is what drove me to take on a new challenge. Because I don't want to just create new information.

I want to make that information useful.
